Investigation on a mobile fire extinguishing approach using liquid carbon dioxide as inert medium for underground mine Data set
Injecting the inert gas into the fire zone is the most effective mean used to control the disaster, there are various types of injection equipment for mining inert media, and the comparison is shown in Table 1.
Table 1. Comparison of injection equipment for mining inert media.
Equipment name	Production mechanism	Gas production
（m3/h）	Equipment unit price
（RMB）	Gas production cost
（RMB/m3）	Technical performance
Fuel inert gas fire extinguishing device	Generate inert gas by burning kerosene.	1 000	1.20 million	3.00	Gas contains a small amount of oxygen and carbon monoxide, resulting in poor safety，which has been eliminated. 
Nitrogen generator	Gas production by air separation method.	1 000	2.00 million	2.00	High outlet temperature and high maintenance frequency; The maximum oxygen content in membrane separation gas production is 5%.
Carbon-dioxide generator	Gas production from the reaction of concentrated sulfuric acid and sodium bicarbonate.	1 000	0.85 million	8.00	Chemical reaction production has low safety, low gas production, and a purity of 98%.
Liquid carbon dioxide gasification and injection system	Chemical reaction production has Low safety, low gas production, and a purity of 98%.	1 170	0.80 million	1.80	Direct injection of liquid can suffocate, cool down, dilute gas, suppress explosion, and Prevent reignition in fire areas; Chemical plants produce liquids with a purity of nearly 100%, providing strong resource guarantee.
