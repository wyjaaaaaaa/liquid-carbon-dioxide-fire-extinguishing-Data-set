Investigation on a mobile fire extinguishing approach using liquid carbon dioxide as inert medium for underground mine Data set
Injecting the inert gas into the fire zone is the most effective mean used to control the disaster, there are various types of injection equipment for mining inert media, and the comparison is shown in Table 1.The characteristic quantities of degree of fit for each measuring point are shown in Table 2.
The above mentioned characteristic quantities of temperature change in 200 s on the liquid gasification jet path are shown in Table 3.
